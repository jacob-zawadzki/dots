# You can configure unique text to display for any given player
# It works by doing a partial match against a players name
# So for Firefox for example, which is advertised as 'Mozilla Firefox', you'd want something like this:
#
# [icons.players]
# mozilla = 'icon'
#
# Even 'moz' would work, but obviously more specific strings are better to ensure the correct player is matched
[icons.players]
default = ""
sample-player = "🔊"
